<p>I am a 20 year old male living in <span style="background-color: lightblue; border thin solid darkblue;">Kent, Ohio.</span> As a nurturer, I enjoy bringing people up, and get high off of being around others. I want my life to have purpose, meaning that I get to the end with little to no regrets.</p>

<p>As a shy and young child, I spent a lot of my time on the computer and developed a liking for technology. In my teens, I quickly learned skills such as graphic design, commentary, editing, and computer building. Out of high school, I went to <strong>Lakeland Community College</strong>. I learned a lot there, but ended up dropping out and joining the work force. I've worked in the Retail, Restaurant, and Logistics businesses. During this period of time, I learned a lot about what I wanted to do with my life. </p>

<p>I've always been the type of person to juggle different hobbies. One of my favorite pastimes is creating video content about mysterious and lost media. I do the script writing, editing, commentary, and graphics for each video. I also enjoy music, and mixing it too. Playing Poker whether with friends or random people is extremely fun. I've also held, and dealt my own games, including a few charity poker tournaments with my father.  </p>
